## Description

_This application will allow employees track the availability status of wetsuits for rent. This is the database side of the application._

_The primary goals will be an easy access application that sorts wetsuits by availability (in, out, available or reserved).  It should also have and 'effective size' category for suits which are technically classified as one size, but because of the brand are far close to another._

* _Access the GitHub repository by copying this (https://github.com/ELee-Wuollet13/Capstone.git) link into a console command to 'git clone [link]'_
* _navigate into the program with the console and enter 'bash startup.bash' as a command, followed by 'rails s' which will build, seed and start the database._
* _If the 'startup.bash' does not work, manually enter the commands 'bundle install, rails db:create, rake db:migrate, rake db:seed, rails s' which will start the Database._
